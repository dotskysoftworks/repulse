# rePulse
### version 0.8-alpha

	rePulse is a game where you listen to the sound around you to get a clue of what you should do. The platforms move with the music, the music affects the buttons you need to push, the music also evolves following the things that you've done in the world.

## Current Features

- Two levels
- Autosave feature
- Basic UI

## Work Needed

- Slight jitter on moving platforms
- Better, lag-free synchronization with the music (stutters make the platforms off-sync)
- Work more on the second level
- Placeholder models need to be replaced
